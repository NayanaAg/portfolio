## Elements I'm proud of
I learned a lot while coding this project, especially because it's the first big website I made using react.  
Some interesting coding snippets:  

- The carousels are generated with a component that reads images out of a JSON array
- The sort and filter buttons on the project page were made using array mapping, filtering, and use states
- The scrolling marquee of hobbies is constantly growing, and requires almost as much updating as my project list
